# Hidden Gems

This is a database project for the school I am attending, Code Institute. This project is for Milestone 3 (data-centric backend development). Its purpose is to prove that I can code backend Python logic.
 
## CHANGES
MongoDB database rename

logged into mongo cli

command:

show dbs



## UX
 
Basic website for showcasing data manipulation via CRUD in MongoDB. JQuery is used for the RWD hamburger side pop-out menu. MaterializeCSS is used for an increased overall appearance. MaterializeCSS was chosen over Bootstrap as I am not a fan of Bootstrap because it makes every website look identical and not custom, this is a personal preference of mine.

<br />
CRUD functions are handled via buttons for UI simplicity.

### User Stories/Extended Scenarios
    Anyone interested in locating Hidden Gems, which are local locations that don't get much if any publication, but are the most amazing places.

    The average user to this site could Register to become a Community Member and Login to access database features that are only available to registered users.

    Editing and Deleting posts directly communicates with MongoDB and only the post creator can see those buttons for their own posts.

    Everyone can view all posts.
******
### Wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that were created as part of the design process.
https://github.com/LogicAtom/TargetShooter/tree/main/wireframes/versions/version2

Documentation for wireframes: I have included the wireframes in sequential order to show my direction for the layout, even though the final product doesn't use some of the elements. Its pretty self explanatory.

#### Features
Feature 1  - MongoDB CRUD functionality
Feature 2  - User authorization
Feature 3  - RWD
