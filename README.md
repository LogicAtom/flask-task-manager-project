# Task Manager

About: This is a database project for the school I am attending, Code Institute. This project is for Milestone 3 (data-centric backend development). 

Purpose: To provide a database that is intuitive to use and easy to interact with while looking good and being mobile web responsive.
 
## üöÄ Features

- [x] MongoDB CRUD functionality

- [x] CSS enhanced GUI

- [x] Security

## MAJOR CHANGES
Redesigning project into a general usage Task Manager

file names changes:

get_gems to get_tasks

gems to tasks

gem to task

JQuery Form Validation (custom error messages)

npm install jquery

### CHANGES
MongoDB database rename

logged into mongo cli

command:

show dbs

help

use task_manager

<br />
'''''
<code>db.getCollectionNames().forEach(function(collName) {
    db[collName].find().forEach(function(d){
        db.getSiblingDB('ms3_db')[collName].insert(d); 
    }) 
});
</code><br />
=== SUCCESS ...copied Database named: task_manager, to, a new Database, named: ms3_db

<br />

Now I need to rename the 'tasks' collection to 'gems'...
<br />
<code>use ms3_db</code> to switch to that database., then type this to rename the collection<br />
<code>db.tasks.renameCollection('tasks')</code><br />

<br />

********* ATTEMPT 1....SUCCESS!

show collections

now shows:
1. categories
2. gems
3. users

## UX
 
Basic website for showcasing data manipulation via CRUD in MongoDB. JQuery is used for the RWD hamburger side pop-out menu. MaterializeCSS is used for an increased overall appearance.

<br />
CRUD functions are handled via buttons for UI simplicity.

### User Stories/Extended Scenarios
    Average person looking to add Tasks into a MongoDB database with a calendar due date and urgent or non-urgent switch.

    Editing and Deleting posts directly communicates with MongoDB and only the post creator can see those buttons for their own posts.

    Everyone can view all posts.
******
### Wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that were created as part of the design process. 
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS SECTION NEEDS UPDATING

https://github.com/LogicAtom/TargetShooter/tree/main/wireframes/versions/version2

Documentation for wireframes: I have included the wireframes in sequential order to show my direction for the layout, even though the final product doesn't use some of the elements. Its pretty self explanatory.


## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/LogicAtom/flask-task-manager-project.git
```

2. Change the working directory

```Bash
cd flask-task-manager-project.htm
```

3. Add Environment Variable path of this directory

4. Run the app using terminal

The dependancies should automatically install via the "requirements.txt" file, but just in case I have included the methods for manually installing the dependancies written directly below as pip3:

## Pip3 Installs
pip3 install dnspython
<br/>
pip3 install pymongo
<br />
pip3 install flask_pymongo
<br />
pip3 install Flask
<br />

## Deployment/Environments

**üéá You are Ready to Go!**

### ‚ùó Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

```Bash
create
```

Either run this command in the project folder or set the path of `create.bat` in the environmental variable for executing create command anywhere (Run, cmd, or PowerShell).

```Bash
create <project_name>
```

For creating Local Repo use this command and it will create a local repository in the path provided.

```Bash
create <project_name> -g
```

For creating a Global Repo use this command and it will create a global repository on your GitHub profile using `gh` and make & push the initial commit.

```Bash
create <project_name> -o
```

For creating an Organization Repo use this command and it will create an Organization repository on your GitHub profile using `gh` and make & push the initial commit

> If you pass any other option like `-pr` then the repo will be private otherwise it will be public
