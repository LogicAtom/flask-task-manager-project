# Task Manager

About: This is a database project for the school I am attending, Code Institute. This project is for Milestone 3 (data-centric backend development). 

Purpose: To provide a database that is intuitive to use and easy to interact with while looking good and being mobile web responsive.
 
## üöÄ Features

- [x] MongoDB CRUD functionality

- [x] CSS enhanced GUI

- [x] Security

- [x] Mobile Responsive web design with JQuery hamburger menu

- [x] Add Documentation

### üéä  Security Features
Environment variable <br />
.gitignore <br />
User Authentication <br />

<br />

### Database Queries and Changes
'''''
<code>db.getCollectionNames().forEach(function(collName) {
    db[collName].find().forEach(function(d){
        db.getSiblingDB('ms3_db')[collName].insert(d); 
    }) 
});
</code><br />
=== SUCCESS ...copied Database named: task_manager, to, a new Database, named: ms3_db

''''
<br />

Now I need to rename the 'tasks' collection to 'task_manager'...
<br />
<code>use ms3_db</code> to switch to that database., then type this to rename the collection<br />
<code>db.task_manager.renameCollection('task_manager')</code><br />

********* ATTEMPT 1....SUCCESS!

show collections

now shows:
1. categories
2. tasks
3. users

## UX
 
Basic website for showcasing data manipulation via CRUD in MongoDB. JQuery is used for the RWD hamburger side pop-out menu. MaterializeCSS is used for an increased overall appearance.

<br />
CRUD functions are handled via buttons for UI simplicity.

### User Stories/Extended Scenarios
    Average person looking to add Tasks into a MongoDB database with a calendar due date and urgent or non-urgent switch.

    Editing and Deleting posts directly communicates with MongoDB and only the post creator can see those buttons for their own posts.

    Everyone can view all posts.
******
### Wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that were created as part of the design process. 
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS SECTION NEEDS UPDATING

https://github.com/LogicAtom/TargetShooter/tree/main/wireframes/versions/version2

Documentation for wireframes: I have included the wireframes in sequential order to show my direction for the layout, even though the final product doesn't use some of the elements. Its pretty self explanatory.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/LogicAtom/flask-task-manager-project.git
```

2. Change the working directory

```Bash
cd flask-task-manager-project.htm
```

3. Add Environment Variable path of this directory

4. Run the app using terminal

The dependancies should automatically install via the "requirements.txt" file, but just in case I have included the methods for manually installing the dependancies written directly below as pip3:

## Pip3 Installs
pip3 install dnspython
<br/>
pip3 install pymongo
<br />
pip3 install flask_pymongo
<br />
pip3 install Flask
<br />

## Deployment/Environments

https://github.com/LogicAtom/flask-task-manager-project/deployments

Deployment via GitPod using git 
Alternate Deployment via Microsoft Visual Studio Code

CLONING:  https://github.com/LogicAtom/flask-task-manager-project.git (or) gh repo clone LogicAtom/flask-task-manager-project
via GitHub Desktop: x-github-client://openRepo/https://github.com/LogicAtom/flask-task-manager-project
Download .zip file:  https://github.com/LogicAtom/flask-task-manager-project/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

### ‚ùó Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

```Bash
create
```

Either run this command in the project folder or set the path of `create.bat` in the environmental variable for executing create command anywhere (Run, cmd, or PowerShell).

```Bash
create <project_name>
```

For creating Local Repo use this command and it will create a local repository in the path provided.

```Bash
create <project_name> -g
```

```Bash
create <project_name> -o
```

For creating an Organization Repo use this command and it will create an Organization repository on your GitHub profile using `gh` and make & push the initial commit

> If you pass any other option like `-pr` then the repo will be private otherwise it will be public
